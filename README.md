## Handwritten Number Classifier

Hey everyone, this is my handwritten number classifier. Although this isn't something like a formal project such as the other examples I have on my GitHub, this is one of the things that I thought was amazing.
Learning about convolutional neural networks was a little bit difficult at first, but after reviewing the materials that **Break Through Tech** provided for me, I was able to wrap my head around how neural networks
recognize images, and how clever their designs are.

Anyways, aside from me nerding out to pretty much anyone who would listen to me about this, I decided to put it here because I want to go in this direction in terms of my career, where my fascination mingles with
reality and produces something that actually works.
